# Prodigy Infotech Internship – Task 03

## Title:
Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree

## Objective:
Build a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.

## Dataset:
Bank Marketing Dataset / Customer Churn Dataset

## Algorithm Used:
Decision Tree Classifier (Scikit-Learn)

## Steps Performed:
- Loaded and cleaned dataset
- Performed label encoding
- Split data into training and testing
- Trained Decision Tree model
- Evaluated model using accuracy and classification report
- Visualized decision tree

## Model Accuracy:
87% accuracy achieved on test dataset.

## Tools & Libraries:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib

## Result:
The Decision Tree model successfully predicts whether a customer will purchase a product based on their profile.

## Conclusion:
Decision Tree provided good accuracy and interpretability. The model can be used for customer targeting and marketing strategies.
